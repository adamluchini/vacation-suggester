          <h1>Portland!</h1>
          <p>What do you want to leave for? Everything you dig is right here in PDX, dude. Save yourself from the stresses of traveling and kick back around town. I'm here, we can hang out if you want!</p>

          <h1>Bend!</h1>
          <p>Everything you could ever want is in Bend, minus the hustle and bustle of the busy city. Plus it's only a quick drive away. Stop off at the Dairy Queen in Madras on your way there becuase it's the best DQ in the world, I swear!</p>

          <p>You've never heard of Foam Lake, Saskatchewan??? Nobody has! That's why it'll be fun... Maybe? Grab that passport, hop on that long train ride and find out what this tiny town is like. They probably have a bar so you'll be good.</p>

          <h1>British Columbia!</h1>
          <p>Check out a metropolis done by our Canadian friends up north. British Columbia is quickly becoming a growing, busy city with plenty to do. Plus I hear Canadians are really nice!</p>

          <h1>Chicago!</h1>
          <p>Sounds like you're in the mood to see some huge buildings! Well look no further than Chicago, one of the biggest cities on earth. Go up to top of the Sears Tower and put your head on the glass like that scene from Ferris Bueller! CHICK. CHICKA CHICKAHHHH.</p>

          <h1>Reno!</h1>
          <p>Reno is home to cheap drinks and loose slots so your friends and you will have an absolute blast boozin' it up. Mind your words, though. Don't be that person that continuously says, "Vegas is way more fun." Nobody likes that person!</p>

          </div>
          <h1>Mt. Hood!</h1>
          <p>Drinking is overrated. I've never said that but I assume you're the type that does. Do some  quiet hiking and camping up on one of the most beautiful mountains in America. Don't invite me though, because I'm not goin'. Sounds whack.</p>
